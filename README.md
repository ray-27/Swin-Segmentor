# Swin Transformer for Cityscapes Segmentation

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a sophisticated image segmentation model using the Swin Transformer architecture, specifically designed for segmenting complex urban environments in the Cityscapes dataset. This model excels at accurately classifying various elements of urban scenes through innovative adaptations to traditional transformer techniques.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Model Development**: Uses the Swin Transformer architecture tailored for high-resolution urban scene segmentation.
- **Adaptive Image Handling**: Capable of efficiently processing images of varied sizes with adaptive resizing and patching techniques to preserve high-resolution details essential for precise segmentation.
- **Cutting-edge Architecture**: Implements the Swin Transformer with shifted windows for hierarchical representation, improving the capture of fine details in dense urban scenes.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Extensive tuning, including learning rate adjustments and optimizer selection, enhances model convergence and segmentation accuracy.
- **Robust Data Processing**: Incorporates advanced data preprocessing and augmentation strategies to increase model robustness against real-world variations like different lighting conditions and occlusions.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Utilizes standard segmentation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Pixel Accuracy to verify model accuracy and reliability.
- **Collaborative Development**: Developed in collaboration with a team of skilled data scientists and engineers, with a focus on continuous refinement and knowledge sharing.
